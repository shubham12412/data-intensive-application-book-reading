# Chapter 3. Storage and Retrieval

On the most fundamental level, a database needs to do two things: when you give it some data, it should store the data, and when you ask it again later, it should give the data back to you.

In Chapter 2 we discussed data models and query languages—i.e., the format in which you (the application developer) give the database your data, and the mechanism by which you can ask for it again later. In this chapter we discuss the same from the database’s point of view: how we can store the data that we’re given, and how we can find it again when we’re asked for it.


We will examine two families of ***storage engines***: ***log-structured storage engines***, and ***page-oriented storage engines such as B-trees***.

### Data Structures That Power Your Database

many databases internally use a ***log, which is an append-only data file***. Real databases have more issues to deal with (such as concurrency control, reclaiming disk space so that the log doesn’t grow forever, and handling errors and partially written records), but the basic principle is the same. Logs are incredibly useful, and we will encounter them several times in the rest of this book.

NOTE \
The word log is often used to refer to application logs, where an application outputs text that describes what’s happening. In this book, ***log*** is used in the more general sense: ***an append-only sequence of records***. It doesn’t have to be human-readable; it might be binary and intended only for other programs to read.

***In order to efficiently find the value for a particular key in the database, we need a different data structure: an index***. In this chapter we will look at a range of indexing structures and see how they compare; the general idea behind them is to keep some additional metadata on the side, which acts as a signpost and helps you to locate the data you want. If you want to search the same data in several different ways, you may need several different indexes on different parts of the data.

***An index is an additional structure that is derived from the primary data***. Many databases allow you to add and remove indexes, and this doesn’t affect the contents of the database; it only affects the performance of queries. Maintaining additional structures incurs overhead, especially on writes. For writes, it’s hard to beat the performance of simply appending to a file, because that’s the simplest possible write operation. ***Any kind of index usually slows down writes, because the index also needs to be updated every time data is written***.

***This is an important trade-off in storage systems: well-chosen indexes speed up read queries, but every index slows down writes***. For this reason, databases don’t usually index everything by default, but require you—the application developer or database administrator—to choose indexes manually, using your knowledge of the application’s typical query patterns. You can then choose the indexes that give your application the greatest benefit, without introducing more overhead than necessary.



#### Hash Indexes

Let’s start with indexes for key-value data. This is not the only kind of data you can index, but it’s very common, and it’s a useful building block for more complex indexes.

Key-value stores are quite similar to the dictionary type that you can find in most programming languages, and which is usually implemented as a hash map (hash table).Since we already have hash maps for our in-memory data structures, why not use them to index our data on disk?

Let’s say our data storage consists only of appending to a file, as in the preceding example. Then the simplest possible indexing strategy is this: keep an in-memory hash map where every key is mapped to a byte offset in the data file—the location at which the value can be found, as illustrated in Figure 3-1. Whenever you append a new key-value pair to the file, you also update the hash map to reflect the offset of the data you just wrote (this works both for inserting new keys and for updating existing keys). When you want to look up a value, use the hash map to find the offset in the data file, seek to that location, and read the value.
